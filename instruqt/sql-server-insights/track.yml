    \ Insights is now included in every Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription.\n\n\
    In most Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 installations, the insights-client software\

    \ installing the insights-client package and it will likely need it installed.\
    \  \n\nInstall the insights-client package on the machine.\n\n```\nyum -y install\

      # Concepts included in this scenario:

      * Register a system with Red Hat Insights

      * View recommendations triggered for the system on cloud.redhat.com

      * Remediate a recommendation for the system running SQL Server

      * Validate resolution by running the commands suggested by Insights

      * Confirm that SQL Server is running at the end of this exercise


      # Example Usecase:

      A system administrator running SQL Server on RHEL, is not yet familiar with
      all the best practices to run SQL Server on RHEL. The system administrator depends
      on insights to provide the proactive insights to configure their SQL Server
      instance on RHEL.

    ![Navigate to Inventory](./assets/insights-homepage-inventory-highlight-new.png)


    Once you are on the Inventory page, find and click your hostname to pull up information
