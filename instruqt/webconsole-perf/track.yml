    Navigate to the system Overview, Performance metrics section


    Notice the graph that shows the CPU, Disk I/O and Network utilization


    ![Look at Perf Activity at a glance](./assets/Perf_at_a_glance2.png)


    There are vertical lines for each system resource - CPU, Memory, Disk and Network


    For CPU, the graph on the left of the line shows the **utilization**, and the
    graph on the right of the graph shows the **saturation**
