    Notice that there are a mix of updates available for the system.  Some of these

    are identified as __Security Updates__ by the shield icon in the __Severity__
    field.


    Also, you will notice that there is a button in the upper left corner entitled

    __Install Security Updates__.

    After the security updates are applied, you are prompted to restart the system
    so that the updates take effect.  We are not yet finished applying updates, so,
    for now, please __Ignore__ the restart request.
