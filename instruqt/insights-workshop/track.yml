    After selecting your system from the Inventory page and reviewing some

    overall data about it, click on the _Advisor_ tab to view the Red Hat

    Insights data that applies to this host.


    ![Host Insights](./assets/host-homepage-v2.png)


    There may be several recommendations listed for this system.  Scroll down through
    the

    list until you reach the one entitled _Network connection loss occurs when the
    NetworkManager uses an internal DHCP client_


    ![NetworkManager Insight](./assets/NetworkManager-issue.png)


    From the _Detected issues_ section of the recommendation, you can see that this
    recommendation

    is being triggered by the machine running an older version of NetworkManager.


    ![NetworkManager Insight issue](./assets/NetworkManager-detected-issue.png)


    In the _Steps to resolve_ section of the recommendation, step-by-step

    guidance on how to resolve the issue is provided.  In this case, to

    update the system and restart the service.


    ![NetworkManager Issue Resolution](./assets/NetworkManager-resolution.png)


    The _Steps to resolve_ section continues with an additional option for

    remediating the recommendation if you are unable to update the NetworkManager

    RPM.  Specifically, the recommendation includes some additional file

    configuration settings followed by a service restart.
