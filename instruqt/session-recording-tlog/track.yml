- assignment: "# Reviewing a recorded session from the command-line\n\nThe command\
    \ to use to review recorded sessions from the command-line is\n`tlog-play`, which\
    \ takes a session identifier to determine which session data\nto replay.  \n\n\
    In the default configuration, recorded session data is sent to the \n__journald__\
    \ managed log.  As a result, to determine the available session\ndata, you will\
    \ use the `journalctl`.  The following command will search\nthrough the journal\
    \ log and locate strings that contain the <pre>\"rec\"</pre>\nstring, plus the\
    \ identifier included in that message.\n\n```\njournalctl -o verbose | grep -P\
    \ \"\\\"rec\\\".*?\\,\"\n```\n\nBelow, is an example of one of those messages,\
    \ but there will likely be more \nthan one message associated with each session.\n\
    \n![Journal Log Message](./assets/log-message.png)\n\nTo replay the session, you\
    \ run `tlog-play` with the session identifier, using\nthe log message displayed\
    \ above, the command would look like:   \n`tlog-play -r journal -M TLOG_REC=b9dd6a8391714e42be4f6f885875d48f-22ea-c2f05`\n\
    \nYour session identifier is going to be different, the following command will\n\
    use some shell tools to isolate the first recording from your journal.  As you\n\
    replay the session, your existing terminal session will be used for the replay.\n\
    once the replay is complete, your session will be returned to your control.  You\n\
    can interrupt the playback with a &lt;CTRL&gt;-C.\n\n```\ntlog-play -r journal\
    \ -M TLOG_REC=$(journalctl -o verbose | grep -P \"\\\"rec\\\".*?\\.\" | cut -d,\
    \ -f3 | cut -d: -f2 | head -n 1 | sed -e s/\\\"//g)\n```\n\nThe above command\
    \ will replay the session to completion, in real-time.\n\n"
